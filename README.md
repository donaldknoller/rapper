A simple wrapper for redis

## Why?
Sometimes you just need to use redis but from an http interface for ...reasons.

In the age of convenient cloud services, maybe you stil want to run redis on a good old VPS and want to get something up and running quickly. 

Hopefully this will help with that: a simple http server that uses some auth and interacts with redis


## Getting Started
```sh
bun install
```


## Development
To start the development server run:
```bash
bun run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000/ with your browser to see the result.
